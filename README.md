# Copier Template for Semantic Release

Copier Template to Set up Semantic Release

## Development Status

This project uses [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) for versioning.
Any time the major version changes, there may be breaking changes. If it is working well for you, consider
pegging to the current major version, e.g. `copier-semantic-release@v1`, to avoid breaking changes. Alternatively,
you can always point to the most recent stable release with the `copier-semantic-release@latest`.

## Developing

Clone the repo and then run `npm install` to set up the pre-commit hooks.
